              	adapting continuous word representations using
              	linguistically motivated subword units: phonemes,

              	provides a significant gain in performance over
              	previous methods relying on these resources. We
              	demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on
              	Named Entity Recognition for four languages, namely
              	Uyghur, Turkish, Bengali and Hindi, of which Uyghur
              	and Bengali are low resource languages, and also
              	perform experiments on Machine
              	Translation. Exploiting subwords with transfer
              	learning gives us a boost of +15.2 NER F1 for Uyghur
